# üìä S&P100 Analysis with Graph Neural Networks üìà
This project focuses on analyzing the S&P100 stocks, which represent 100 leading U.S. stocks, using the power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for comprehensive insights.

## Overview
The project comprises two main phases:

1. **Data Collection and Pre-processing**: This phase involves collecting historical data, particularly stock prices, and constructing graphs to depict relationships between stocks based on factors like sector and correlation.

2. **Data Analysis**: In this phase, we delve into various analyses and modeling tasks using PyTorch Geometric library for GNNs. This includes price forecasting, stocks clustering, and more.

## Notebooks
To facilitate understanding and execution, the project is organized into several Jupyter notebooks:

1. [Data collection and preprocessing](https://github.com/timothewt/SP100_Analysis_with_GNNs/blob/master/notebooks/1-data_collection_and_preprocessing.ipynb): This notebook provides detailed instructions and code for collecting stock data (sectors, fundamentals, historical prices).

2. [Graph creation](https://github.com/timothewt/SP100_Analysis_with_GNNs/blob/master/2-graph_creation.ipynb): Focuses on the creation of graphs to model relationships between S&P100 stocks based on sector and fundamentals correlation.

3. [PyTorch Geometric custom dataset](https://github.com/timothewt/SP100_Analysis_with_GNNs/blob/master/3-torch_geometric_dataset.ipynb): Demonstrates how to use PyTorch Geometric to create datasets suitable for GNN training and evaluation.

4. [Temporal Graph Neural Network Models](https://github.com/timothewt/SP100_Analysis_with_GNNs/blob/master/5-temporal_gnn_models.ipynb): Implementation of Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks, such as T-GCN and A3T-GCN.

5. [Stock prices forecasting](https://github.com/timothewt/SP100_Analysis_with_GNNs/blob/master/6-stock_prices_forecasting.ipynb): Focuses on using Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGCNNs) for forecasting future stock prices, enabling predictive analysis.

6. [Stocks clustering with Deep Graph Clustering](https://github.com/timothewt/SP100_Analysis_with_GNNs/blob/master/6-stocks_clustering.ipynb): Uses a novel architecture - Temporal Convolutional Graph Autoencoder - to cluster stocks based on the graph structure and their historical prices.

7. [TODO] [S&P100 weights optimization via Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/timothewt/SP100_Analysis_with_GNNs/blob/master/7-portfolio_optimization.ipynb): Uses Deep Reinforcement Learning to optimize the weights of the 100 stocks in the S&P100 based on historical data and GNN predictions. The goal of the agent is to outperform the equal weights S&P100 index by adjusting its portfolio to the current market.
