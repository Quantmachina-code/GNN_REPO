# üìä S&P100 Analysis with Graph Neural Networks üìà
Welcome to the S&P100 Analysis with Graph Neural Networks project! This project focuses on analyzing the S&P100 stocks, which represent 100 leading U.S. stocks, utilizing the power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for comprehensive insights.

## Overview
The project comprises two main phases:

1. **Data Collection and Pre-processing**: This phase involves collecting historical data, particularly stock prices, and constructing graphs to depict relationships between stocks based on factors like sector and correlation.

2. **Data Analysis**: In this phase, we delve into various analyses and modeling tasks using PyTorch Geometric library for GNNs. This includes variation forecasting, stocks clustering, link prediction, and more.

## Notebooks
To facilitate understanding and execution, the project is organized into several Jupyter notebooks:

1. [1-data_collection_and_preprocessing.ipynb](https://github.com/timothewt/SP100_Analysis_with_GNNs/blob/master/notebooks/1-data_collection_and_preprocessing.ipynb): This notebook provides detailed instructions and code for collecting stock data (sectors, fundamentals, historical prices).

2. [2-graph_creation.ipynb](https://github.com/timothewt/SP100_Analysis_with_GNNs/blob/master/2-graph_creation.ipynb): Focuses on the creation of graphs to model relationships between S&P100 stocks based on sector and fundamentals correlation.

3. [3-torch_geometric_dataset.ipynb](https://github.com/timothewt/SP100_Analysis_with_GNNs/blob/master/3-torch_geometric_dataset.ipynb): Demonstrates how to utilize PyTorch Geometric to create datasets suitable for GNN training and evaluation.

4. [TODO] [4-stocks_clustering.ipynb](https://github.com/timothewt/SP100_Analysis_with_GNNs/blob/master/4-stocks_clustering.ipynb): Explores clustering techniques using GNNs to group similar stocks together based on various features.

5. [TODO] [5-stocks_link_prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/timothewt/SP100_Analysis_with_GNNs/blob/master/5-stocks_link_prediction.ipynb): Investigates link prediction, aiming to forecast potential connections or relationships between different stocks within the S&P100.

6. [In-process] [6-stock_variations_forecasting.ipynb](https://github.com/timothewt/SP100_Analysis_with_GNNs/blob/master/6-stock_variations_forecasting.ipynb): Focuses on using TGCNs for forecasting variations in stock prices, enabling predictive analysis.

7. [TODO] [7-portfolio_optimization.ipynb](https://github.com/timothewt/SP100_Analysis_with_GNNs/blob/master/7-portfolio_optimization.ipynb): Uses Deep Reinforcement Learning to optimize a portfolio of S&P100 stocks based on historical data and GNN predictions.
