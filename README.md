# S&P100 Analysis with Graph Neural Networks
This project aims to analyze the S&P100 stocks, 100 leading U.S. stocks, using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
The project is divided into two main parts: 
- Data collection and pre-processing, collecting historical data (stock prices), and using graphs to model relations between stocks (sector, correlation).
- Data analysis, building GNN models for variation forecasting, stock clustering and link prediction.
