# üìä S&P100 Analysis with Graph Neural Networks üìà
This project focuses on analyzing the S&P100 stocks, which represent 100 leading U.S. stocks, using the power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for comprehensive insights.

## Overview
The project is divided into several sections, each focusing on a different aspect of the S&P100 analysis:

1. **Data collection, preprocessing and graph creation**: This section focuses on collecting and preprocessing the necessary data for the analysis, such as stock fundamentals, historical prices, and sector information. It also creates graphs to model relationships between S&P100 stocks based on sector and fundamentals correlation.

2. **Temporal Graph Neural Network Models**: This section focuses on implementing Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (T-GCNs) and Attention-based Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (A3T-GCNs) for traffic forecasting.

3. **Using GNNs for various tasks**: Price forecasting, stocks clustering, trend classification, and portfolio optimization.

## Notebooks
To facilitate understanding and execution, the project is organized into several Jupyter notebooks:

1. [Data collection and preprocessing](https://github.com/timothewt/SP100_Analysis_with_GNNs/blob/master/notebooks/1-data_collection_and_preprocessing.ipynb): This notebook provides detailed instructions and code for collecting stock data (sectors, fundamentals, historical prices).

2. [Graph creation](https://github.com/timothewt/SP100_Analysis_with_GNNs/blob/master/2-graph_creation.ipynb): Focuses on the creation of graphs to model relationships between S&P100 stocks based on sector and fundamentals correlation.

3. [PyTorch Geometric custom dataset](https://github.com/timothewt/SP100_Analysis_with_GNNs/blob/master/3-torch_geometric_dataset.ipynb): Demonstrates how to use PyTorch Geometric to create datasets suitable for GNN training and evaluation.

4. [Temporal Graph Neural Network Models](https://github.com/timothewt/SP100_Analysis_with_GNNs/blob/master/5-temporal_gnn_models.ipynb): Implementation of Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks, such as T-GCN and A3T-GCN.

5. [Stock prices forecasting](https://github.com/timothewt/SP100_Analysis_with_GNNs/blob/master/6-stock_prices_forecasting.ipynb): Focuses on using Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGCNNs) for forecasting future stock prices, enabling predictive analysis.

6. [Stocks clustering with Deep Graph Clustering](https://github.com/timothewt/SP100_Analysis_with_GNNs/blob/master/6-stocks_clustering.ipynb): Uses a novel architecture - Temporal Convolutional Graph Autoencoder - to cluster stocks based on the graph structure and their historical prices.

7. [S&P100 weights optimization via Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/timothewt/SP100_Analysis_with_GNNs/blob/master/7-sp100_weights_optimization_via_drl.ipynb): Uses Deep Reinforcement Learning to optimize the weights of the 100 stocks in the S&P100 based on historical data and GNN predictions. The goal of the agent is to outperform the equal weights S&P100 index by adjusting its portfolio to the current market. **Note**: I do not have the necessary computing resources to completely train the model in this notebook. However, the code is provided for reference and is fully functional.

8. [Stocks trend classification](https://github.com/timothewt/SP100_Analysis_with_GNNs/blob/master/8-stock_trend_classification.ipynb): Uses a Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (T-GCN) to classify the trend of S&P100 stocks (up/down) $n$ weeks ahead based on historical data.
